# cogment python SDK

## Introduction

The Cogment framework is a high-efficiency, open source framework designed to enable the training of models in environments where humans and agents interact with the environment and each other continuously. Itâ€™s capable of distributed, multi-agent, multi-model training.

This is the python API for making use of the cogment framework when working with the Python programming language.
