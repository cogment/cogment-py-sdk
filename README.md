## Introduction

The Cogment framework is a high-efficiency, open source framework designed to enable the training of models in environments where humans and agents interact with the environment and each other continuously. It‚Äôs capable of distributed, multi-agent, multi-model training.

This is the python API for making use of the cogment framework when working with the Python programming language.

For further Cogment information, check out the documentation at <https://docs.cogment.ai>

## Developers

### Local setup

Make sure you have the following installed:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org) (any version >=3.7 should work),
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).

Install the dependencies, including downloading and building the cogment protobuf API, by navigating to the python SDK directory and run the following

```
poetry install
```

### Define used Cogment protobuf API

The version of the used cogment protobuf API is defined in the `.cogment-api.yaml` file at the root of the repository. The following can be defined:

- `cogment_api_version: "latest"`, is the default, it retrieves the _latest_ build of the cogment-api `develop`,
- `cogment_api_version: "vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE]"`, retrieves an official release of cogment-api.
- `cogment_api_path: "../path/to/cogment-api"`, retrieves a local version of cogment-api found at the given path ; if set, this overrides `cogment_api_version`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è when building a docker image, `cogment_api_path` needs to exists in the docker file system. In practice it means it should be a subdirectory of the current directory.

### Tests

To run them the first step is to configure the way to launch the orchestrator and the cli in a `.env` file. 

You can copy `.env.template` for an example of what's expected.

#### Module tests

These tests only rely on the sdk, no connection to an orchestrator is done.

To execute the module tests, simply run

```
poetry run task test
```

#### Integration tests

These tests launch and use an orchestrator they are slower but more in depth. 

Then, to execute the integration tests (as well as the module tests), simply run

```
poetry run task test --launch-orchestrator
```

These tests can also be launched in a docker image.

```
docker build \
  -t cogment/cogment-py-sdk-integration-test:latest \
  --build-arg COGMENT_IMAGE="<PATH_TO_COGMENT_IMAGE" \
  --build-arg COGMENT_ORCHESTRATOR_IMAGE="<PATH_TO_COGMENT_ORCHESTRATOR_IMAGE" \
  -f integration_test.dockerfile .
docker run --rm cogment/cogment-py-sdk-integration-test:latest
```

### Lint

Run the linter using

```
poetry run task lint
```

### Build the source package

Build the source package (this step will only be succesfull if `poetry install` succeeded)

```
poetry build -f sdist
```

### Build a Docker image

Navigate to the python SDK directory and run the following in order to create an image that can be used by a cogment project:

```
docker build -t image_name .
```
